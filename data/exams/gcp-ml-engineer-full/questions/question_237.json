  "text": "You are developing a model to identify traffic signs in images extracted from videos taken from the dashboard of a vehicle. You have a dataset of 100,000 images that were cropped to show one out of ten different traffic signs. The images have been labeled accordingly for model training, and are stored in a Cloud Storage bucket. You need to be able to tune the model during each training run. How should you train the model?",
