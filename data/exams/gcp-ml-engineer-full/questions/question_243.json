  "text": "You work on a team that builds state-of-the-art deep learning models by using the TensorFlow framework. Your team runs multiple ML experiments each week, which makes it difficult to track the experiment runs. You want a simple approach to effectively track, visualize, and debug ML experiment runs on Google Cloud while minimizing any overhead code. How should you proceed?",
