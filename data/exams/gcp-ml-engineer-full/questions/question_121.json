  "text": "You work for a company that is developing a new video streaming platform. You have been asked to create a recommendation system that will suggest the next video for a user to watch. After a review by an AI Ethics team, you are approved to start development. Each video asset in your companyâ€™s catalog has useful metadata (e.g., content type, release date, country), but you do not have any historical user event data. How should you build the recommendation system for the first version of the product?",
