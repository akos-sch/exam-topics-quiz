  "text": "You work for a magazine publisher and have been tasked with predicting whether customers will cancel their annual subscription. In your exploratory data analysis, you find that 90% of individuals renew their subscription every year, and only 10% of individuals cancel their subscription. After training a NN Classifier, your model predicts those who cancel their subscription with 99% accuracy and predicts those who renew their subscription with 82% accuracy. How should you interpret these results?",
