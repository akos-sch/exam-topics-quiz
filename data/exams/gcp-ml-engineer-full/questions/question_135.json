  "text": "You work for the AI team of an automobile company, and you are developing a visual defect detection model using TensorFlow and Keras. To improve your model performance, you want to incorporate some image augmentation functions such as translation, cropping, and contrast tweaking. You randomly apply these functions to each training batch. You want to optimize your data processing pipeline for run time and compute resources utilization. What should you do?",
