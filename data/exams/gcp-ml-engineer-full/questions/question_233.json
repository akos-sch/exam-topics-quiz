  "text": "You are building a custom image classification model and plan to use Vertex AI Pipelines to implement the end-to-end training. Your dataset consists of images that need to be preprocessed before they can be used to train the model. The preprocessing steps include resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and extracting features. You have already implemented some Python functions for the preprocessing tasks. Which components should you use in your pipeline?",
