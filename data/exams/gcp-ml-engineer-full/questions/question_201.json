  "text": "You developed a Vertex AI pipeline that trains a classification model on data stored in a large BigQuery table. The pipeline has four steps, where each step is created by a Python function that uses the KubeFlow v2 API. The components have the following names:<br/><br/><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/professional-machine-learning-engineer/image3.png\"/><br/><br/>You launch your Vertex AI pipeline as the following:<br/><br/><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/professional-machine-learning-engineer/image4.png\"/><br/><br/>You perform many model iterations by adjusting the code and parameters of the training step. You observe high costs associated with the development, particularly the data export and preprocessing steps. You need to reduce model development costs. What should you do?",
