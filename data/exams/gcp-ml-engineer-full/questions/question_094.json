  "text": "You work on an operations team at an international company that manages a large fleet of on-premises servers located in few data centers around the world. Your team collects monitoring data from the servers, including CPU/memory consumption. When an incident occurs on a server, your team is responsible for fixing it. Incident data has not been properly labeled yet. Your management team wants you to build a predictive maintenance solution that uses monitoring data from the VMs to detect potential failures and then alerts the service desk team. What should you do first?",
