  "text": "You are developing a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. You need to prioritize detection, because missing even one fraudulent transaction could severely impact the credit card holder. You used AutoML to train a model on users' profile information and credit card transaction data. After training the initial model, you notice that the model is failing to detect many fraudulent transactions. How should you increase the number of fraudulent transactions that are detected?",
