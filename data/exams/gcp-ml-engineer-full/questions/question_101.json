You have trained a ResNet architecture on Vertex AI using a TPU as an accelerator, however you are unsatisfied with the training time and memory usage. You want to quickly iterate your training code but make minimal changes to the code. You also want to minimize impact on the modelâ€™s accuracy. What should you do?",
