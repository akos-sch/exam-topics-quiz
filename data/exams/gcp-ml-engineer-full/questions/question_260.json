You have a dataset consisting of a multivariate time series and labels indicating whether the machine part failed. You recently started experimenting with a few different preprocessing and modeling approaches in a Vertex AI Workbench notebook. You want to log data and track artifacts from each run. How should you set up your experiments?",
