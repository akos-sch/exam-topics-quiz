  "text": "You have recently developed a custom model for image classification by using a neural network. You need to automatically identify the values for learning rate, number of layers, and kernel size. To do this, you plan to run multiple jobs in parallel to identify the parameters that optimize performance. You want to minimize custom code development and infrastructure management. What should you do?",
