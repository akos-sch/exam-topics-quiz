  "text": "You have been asked to productionize a proof-of-concept ML model built using Keras. The model was trained in a Jupyter notebook on a data scientistâ€™s local machine. The notebook contains a cell that performs data validation and a cell that performs model analysis. You need to orchestrate the steps contained in the notebook and automate the execution of these steps for weekly retraining. You expect much more training data in the future. You want your solution to take advantage of managed services while minimizing cost. What should you do?",
