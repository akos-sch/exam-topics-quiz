  "text": "You work at a bank. You need to develop a credit risk model to support loan application decisions. You decide to implement the model by using a neural network in TensorFlow. Due to regulatory requirements, you need to be able to explain the model’s predictions based on its features. When the model is deployed, you also want to monitor the model’s performance over time. You decided to use Vertex AI for both model development and deployment. What should you do?",
