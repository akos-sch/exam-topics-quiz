  "text": "You work for a retailer that sells clothes to customers around the world. You have been tasked with ensuring that ML models are built in a secure manner. Specifically, you need to protect sensitive customer data that might be used in the models. You have identified four fields containing sensitive data that are being used by your data science team: AGE, IS_EXISTING_CUSTOMER, LATITUDE_LONGITUDE, and SHIRT_SIZE. What should you do with the data before it is made available to the data science team for training purposes?",
