The data engineering team already built the pipeline and generated a dataset composed of 10,000 images with driver's licenses, 1,000 images with passports, and 1,000 images with credit cards. You now have to train a model with the following label map: [`˜drivers_license', `˜passport', `˜credit_card']. Which loss function should you use?",
