  "text": "You have created a Vertex AI pipeline that includes two steps. The first step preprocesses 10 TB data completes in about 1 hour, and saves the result in a Cloud Storage bucket. The second step uses the processed data to train a model. You need to update the modelâ€™s code to allow you to test different algorithms. You want to reduce pipeline execution time and cost while also minimizing pipeline changes. What should you do?",
