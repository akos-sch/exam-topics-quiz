  "text": "You work for a telecommunications company. Youâ€™re building a model to predict which customers may fail to pay their next phone bill. The purpose of this model is to proactively offer at-risk customers assistance such as service discounts and bill deadline extensions. The data is stored in BigQuery and the predictive features that are available for model training include:\n\n- Customer_id\n- Age\n- Salary (measured in local currency)\n- Sex\n- Average bill value (measured in local currency)\n- Number of phone calls in the last month (integer)\n- Average duration of phone calls (measured in minutes)\n\nYou need to investigate and mitigate potential bias against disadvantaged groups, while preserving model accuracy.\n\nWhat should you do?",
