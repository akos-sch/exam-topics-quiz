You need to complete the following steps:<br/><br/>1. Randomly split the data into training and evaluation datasets in a 65/35 ratio<br/>2. Conduct feature engineering<br/>3. Obtain metrics for the evaluation dataset<br/>4. Compare models trained in different pipeline executions<br/><br/>How should you execute these steps?",
