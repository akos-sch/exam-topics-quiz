The data is structured and stored in BigQuery, and has been carefully managed by a team of data analysts. You need to prepare a report providing insights into the predictive capabilities of the data. You were asked to run several ML models with different levels of sophistication, including simple models and multilayered neural networks. You only have a few hours to gather the results of your experiments. Which Google Cloud tools should you use to complete this task in the most efficient and self-serviced way?",
