  "text": "You work for an auto insurance company. You are preparing a proof-of-concept ML application that uses images of damaged vehicles to infer damaged parts. Your team has assembled a set of annotated images from damage claim documents in the companyâ€™s database. The annotations associated with each image consist of a bounding box for each identified damaged part and the part name. You have been given a sufficient budget to train models on Google Cloud. You need to quickly create an initial model. What should you do?",
