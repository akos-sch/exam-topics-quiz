  "text": "You are an ML researcher and are evaluating multiple deep learning-based model architectures and hyperparameter configurations. You need to implement a robust solution to track the progress of each model iteration, visualize key metrics, gain insights into model internals, and optimize training performance.\n\nYou want your solution to have the most efficient and powerful approach to compare the models and have the strongest visualization abilities. How should you bull this solution?",
