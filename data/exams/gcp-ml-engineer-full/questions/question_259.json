  "text": "You have developed an application that uses a chain of multiple scikit-learn models to predict the optimal price for your company’s products. The workflow logic is shown in the diagram. Members of your team use the individual models in other solution workflows. You want to deploy this workflow while ensuring version control for each individual model and the overall workflow. Your application needs to be able to scale down to zero. You want to minimize the compute resource utilization and the manual effort required to manage this solution. What should you do?\n\n",
