  "text": "You work at an organization that maintains a cloud-based communication platform that integrates conventional chat, voice, and video conferencing into one platform. The audio recordings are stored in Cloud Storage. All recordings have an 8 kHz sample rate and are more than one minute long. You need to implement a new feature in the platform that will automatically transcribe voice call recordings into a text for future applications, such as call summarization and sentiment analysis. How should you implement the voice call transcription feature following Google-recommended best practices?",
