  "text": "You are experimenting with a built-in distributed XGBoost model in Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks. You use BigQuery to split your data into training and validation sets using the following queries:\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ‘myproject.mydataset.training‘ AS\n(SELECT * FROM ‘myproject.mydataset.mytable‘ WHERE RAND() <= 0.8);\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ‘myproject.mydataset.validation‘ AS\n(SELECT * FROM ‘myproject.mydataset.mytable‘ WHERE RAND() <= 0.2);\n\nAfter training the model, you achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) value of 0.8, but after deploying the model to production, you notice that your model performance has dropped to an AUC ROC value of 0.65. What problem is most likely occurring?",
