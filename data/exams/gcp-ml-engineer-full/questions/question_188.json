  "text": "You work at a bank. You have a custom tabular ML model that was provided by the bankâ€™s vendor. The training data is not available due to its sensitivity. The model is packaged as a Vertex AI Model serving container, which accepts a string as input for each prediction instance. In each string, the feature values are separated by commas. You want to deploy this model to production for online predictions and monitor the feature distribution over time with minimal effort. What should you do?",
