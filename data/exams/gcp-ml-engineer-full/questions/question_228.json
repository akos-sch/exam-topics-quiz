  "text": "You are investigating the root cause of a misclassification error made by one of your models. You used Vertex AI Pipelines to train and deploy the model. The pipeline reads data from BigQuery. creates a copy of the data in Cloud Storage in TFRecord format, trains the model in Vertex AI Training on that copy, and deploys the model to a Vertex AI endpoint. You have identified the specific version of that model that misclassified, and you need to recover the data this model was trained on. How should you find that copy of the data?",
