You built a TensorFlow model that predicts whether players will make in-app purchases of more than $10 in the next two weeks. The model’s predictions will be used to adapt each user’s game experience. User data is stored in BigQuery. How should you serve your model while optimizing cost, user experience, and ease of management?",
