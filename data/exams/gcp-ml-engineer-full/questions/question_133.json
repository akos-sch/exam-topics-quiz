  "text": "You have recently created a proof-of-concept (POC) deep learning model. You are satisfied with the overall architecture, but you need to determine the value for a couple of hyperparameters. You want to perform hyperparameter tuning on Vertex AI to determine both the appropriate embedding dimension for a categorical feature used by your model and the optimal learning rate. You configure the following settings:\n•\tFor the embedding dimension, you set the type to INTEGER with a minValue of 16 and maxValue of 64.\n•\tFor the learning rate, you set the type to DOUBLE with a minValue of 10e-05 and maxValue of 10e-02.\n\nYou are using the default Bayesian optimization tuning algorithm, and you want to maximize model accuracy. Training time is not a concern. How should you set the hyperparameter scaling for each hyperparameter and the maxParallelTrials?",
