  "text": "You need to design an architecture that serves asynchronous predictions to determine whether a particular mission-critical machine part will fail. Your system collects data from multiple sensors from the machine. You want to build a model that will predict a failure in the next N minutes, given the average of each sensorâ€™s data from the past 12 hours. How should you design the architecture?",

Your application queries a Vertex AI endpoint where you deployed your model.<br/>3. Responses are received by the caller application as soon as the model produces the prediction.",
